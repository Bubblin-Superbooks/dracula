Then said the Professor as we moved off:—</p><p>“Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of the clock with friend John.

But first I shall have much to say, so that you may know what is to do and to dread. Then our promise shall be made to each other anew; for there is a terrible task before us, and once our feet are on the ploughshare we must not draw back.”</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
