And yet, if it be true, what terrible things there are in the world, and what an awful thing if that man, that monster, be really in London! I fear to think. I have this moment, whilst writing, had a wire from Jonathan, saying that he leaves by the 6:25 to-night from Launceston and will be here at 10:18, so that I shall have no fear to-night. Will you, therefore, instead of lunching with us, please come to breakfast at eight o’clock, if this be not too early for you? You can get away, if you are in a hurry, by the 10:30 train, which will bring you to Paddington by 2:35. Do not answer this, as I shall take it that, if I do not hear, you will come to breakfast.</p><p>“Believe me,<br>“Your faithful and grateful friend,<br>“Mina Harker.”</p><p><em>Jonathan Harker’s Journal.</em></p><p class=" stretch-last-line "><em>26 September._—I thought never to write in this diary</em></p></div> </div>
