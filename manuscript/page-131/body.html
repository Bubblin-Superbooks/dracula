<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">grimly as a man can look as he said:—</p><p>“To-morrow, my friend, we must part. You return to your beautiful England, I to some work which may have such an end that we may never meet. Your letter home has been despatched; to-morrow I shall not be here, but all shall be ready for your journey. In the morning come the Szgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come some Slovaks. When they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shall bear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina to Bistritz. But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle Dracula.” I suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity. Sincerity! It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in connection with such a monster, so asked him point-blank:—</p><p>“Why may I not go to-night?”</p><p>“Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission.”</p></div> </div>
