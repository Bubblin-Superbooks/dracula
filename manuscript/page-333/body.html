<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">have I done to be blessed with such friends?”</p><p>As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:—</p><p>“To-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want—two nights of travel, much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow, and a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in the morning early you call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much more strong for my ‘spell’ which I have work. Ho! ho!”</p><p>He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights before and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. It must have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but I felt it all the more, like unshed tears.</p></div> </div>
